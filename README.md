# embeddedSensor
This project is for an embedded IR sensor that interfaces to Extreme's workflow Composer via a webhook.

The code complies on QT version 5.9.2 and runs on the beaglebone black ARM processor. 

I've developed a custom 'cape' that matches the GPIO to the IR sensors and LEDs.

See the code for the appropriate GPIO pins.
